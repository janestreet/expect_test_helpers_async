(** [with_temp_dir f] creates a temporary directory which is fed to [f].  The directory
    is removed after [f] exits. *)
val with_temp_dir : ?in_dir:string -> (string -> 'a Deferred.t) -> 'a Deferred.t

(** [within_temp_dir ?links f] creates a temporary directory, $T, and:

    1. For each [file, `In_path_as, name] in [links], links [file] as $T/bin/[name].
    2. For each [file, `In_temp_as, name] in [links], links [file] as $T/[name].
    3. Adds $T/bin to the PATH environment variable if step 1 added any links.

    It then [cd]s to $T and calls [f].  After [f] exits, it [cd]s back, removes the
    temporary directory, and restores the original PATH.

    [within_temp_dir] creates hard links to ensure that files remain available and
    unchanged even if jenga starts to rebuild while the test is running.  If [file] and $T
    are not on the same file system, [within_temp_dir] copies the files instead of
    creating hard links. *)

(** [with_env] sets specified environment variables before calling [f].
    After [f] exits, these variables are reset to their previous values. *)

(** [run prog args] creates a child process that runs [prog], with arguments [args], its
    environment extended with [extend_env] and its stdin coming from [stdin].  No
    expansion or escaping is done to [args] or [stdin].  The child process's stdout and
    stderr are captured separately for comparison. *)

(** [system ?stdin cmd] creates a child process that runs [/bin/sh], with arguments
    ["-c"; cmd] and its stdin coming from [stdin]. The child process's stdout and stderr
    are captured separately for comparison. Unlike with [Unix.system], the child shell's
    stdin is never a tty, even if the stdin of this process is a tty, and the child
    shell's stderr is never copied to this process's stderr. *)

(** [show_raise_async ?hide_positions ?rest f] calls [f ()] and prints either the
    exception raised by [f] or "did not raise".  [show_raise_async] ignores the result of
    [f] so that one doesn't have to put an [ignore] inside [f].  [~hide_positions]
    operates as in [print_s], to make output less fragile.  Once a result is returned, the
    rest of the errors are printed to stdout. *)

(** A log that goes to the test runner's controlling terminal, if it exists.

    This log's output is not captured by the expect test runner, and instead appears
    immediately on the attached terminal[1].  This is especially useful when debugging
    expect tests that time out.

    [1]: When tests are run by a build system, there may be no controlling terminal, in
    which case the output of this log is silently discarded.  You would need to run
    [inline_test_runner] interactively to see output from this log. *)

(** Removes connection details (hostnames and ports) from sexps containing the connection
    string "Client connected via TCP" followed by a host and port pair. *)
val remove_connection_details : Sexp.t -> Sexp.t

(** Sets [Async.Log.Global] output to one that elides log timestamps, time spans,
    backtraces, and connection strings with hostnames and ports. These settings help make
    output deterministic. Additionally runs [map_output], if provided, on each log line
    before it is emitted. *)
